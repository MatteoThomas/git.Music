# git.MUSIC

git.MUSIC is an app that allows users to search for a musician or band and find a picture, and audio samples from them. This simple app is a way to quickly see and hear a group or solo artist you might have heard about but don't need their entire back story or entire song catalog. A snazzy photo and a few of their most popular songs is enough for you to decide if the artist in question is worth hearing more of.
